# NFI Cloud Assignment

This document outlines the assignment details for the NFI Cloud project.

Below is the screenshot of the project's terraform directory structure:

### Terraform Configuration Overview

- **Remote State Management:**  
  Uses an AWS S3 bucket for remote state storage, which keeps your state file secure (with encryption) and centralized. You can create this bucket manually or in a separate Terraform project to keep state management isolated and avoid circular dependencies.


### Terraform Environments

- **Workspaces:**  
  Use `terraform workspace` to create and switch between different environments (e.g., dev, staging, production). Each workspace maintains its own state, ensuring that resource changes in one environment donâ€™t impact the others. For example, you can create a new workspace with:  
  ```
  terraform workspace new dev
  ```
  and switch between environments with:
  ```
  terraform workspace select dev
  ```

- **Environment-Specific Files:**  
  Alternatively, you can manage different environments by using separate variable files (such as `.tfvars` files) or environment variables to isolate configuration settings.


### Secure VPC Configuration

- **CIDR Block:**  
  Defines the overall IP address range for the VPC.

- **Subnets:**  
  - **Public Subnet:** Houses resources that require direct internet access via an Internet Gateway.  
  - **Private Subnet:** Isolates backend resources; these access the internet securely using a NAT Gateway.

- **Multi-AZ Deployment:**  
  Subnets are distributed across multiple Availability Zones to ensure high availability and resilience.

- **Gateways & Routing:**  
  - **Internet Gateway:** Provides direct external connectivity for the public subnet.  
  - **NAT Gateway:** Enables secure outbound internet access for resources in the private subnet.  
  - **Route Table:** Configures traffic flow between subnets and the respective gateways.

### Auto Scaling Group Behavior

- **Morning Scaling (6:00 AM):**  
  At the beginning of the day, the auto scaling group launches at least two EC2 instances using the custom AMI created in step 2.

- **Evening Scaling (6:00 PM):**  
  At the end of the day, the auto scaling group terminates all running EC2 instances.


### Billing Report and Notification

- **Event Trigger:**  
  An EventBridge rule monitors EC2 instance terminations, which triggers a Lambda function.

- **Lambda Function:**  
  The EventBridge rule invokes a Lambda function that extracts the billing details for the terminated instance and prepares a report.

- **SNS Email Notification:**  
  The Lambda function publishes this billing report to an SNS topic, which then sends an email to a predefined list of subscribers.

> **Note:** AWS billing data is not available in real-time; there is typically a 24-hour delay. The billing report includes details from the last 2 days to accommodate this delay.


Below is the screenshot of a sample billing report email:

### Overnight EC2 Alarm

- **Scheduled Trigger:**  
  A scheduled EventBridge rule triggers a Lambda function at 6 AM daily.

- **Lambda Function:**  
  The function checks for any EC2 instances that have been running overnight.

- **SNS Notification:**  
  If an instance is found, the Lambda function sends an alert by publishing a notification to an SNS topic, which in turn emails a list of subscribers.

**Sample Alert Email Screenshot:**
